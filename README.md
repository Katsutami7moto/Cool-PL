# Silver
Silver is general-purpose programming language, which goal is to collect many useful features from other languages, but avoid their design and working errors.

## Concepts

- Functional programming features: anonymous functions, first-class functions, closures, currying, partial application, orientation on programminng w/out variables
- Compound types and extension functions will make code more familiar to OOP-users
- No automatical/implicit type conversion, static strong type system
- Statement-based language, not expression-based
- No low-level looking basic types like `uint32` (only `int` and `double` for trivial tasks)
- Silver compiler translates code to C language (C89 standart) for good portabilty and performance
- The core of Silver will be preserved after the end of its development - none of next updates will break compatibility!!!

- Statements
    - [x] Variables/constants definitions (**no declaration w/out definition with a value!**)
        - [x] with type inference, if defined through value/constructor `var/let x = ...;`
        - [x] with explicit type declaration, if defined through expression or function call `var/let x : Type = ...;`
    - [x] Variables assignment (also augmented) `mod x = ...;`
    - [x] Loops
        - [x] Conditional loops: infinite, while, until, do..while, do..until
        - [ ] Container loop: `for x in container doSomething();` or `for x in container { ... }`
    - [x] Conditional: if-elif-else
    - [ ] Pattern matching (stmnt)
- Types
    - [ ] Basic types
        - [x] Bool (`True` and `False` -> `0` and `1` in C)
        - [x] int
        - [x] double
        - [ ] char (Unicode)
        - [ ] Ð¡ontainers with generics
            - [ ] `List<T>` (double-linked list, indexed, with all elements of type T)
            - [ ] `Set<T>` (unordered set, with all elements (no duplicates) of type T)
            - [ ] `Dict<K, T>` (associative array, with all keys (no duplicates) of type K and all elements of type T)
            - [ ] ...
        - [ ] String (based on List of Unicode characters)
        - [ ] Functional type (in C turns to function pointer) (`T -> R` or `R(T)` ??)
        - [ ] BigNum (list based, one for int and float, with ext-functions, flags NoSign, NoFloat, NoComplex and so on..)
        - [ ] ComplexNum
        - [ ] `None`
    - [ ] Compound types
        - [ ] Product types (namedtuple/struct) (x * y * ...) (made of any types)
            - [ ] With generics `<T>`
        - [ ] Intersection types (x & y & ...) (made of product types without equal-named fields) (rename it into 'conjunction type' or smth??)
            - [ ] With generics `<T>`
        - [ ] Variant types (sum/union) (x | y | ...) (made of any types)
            - [ ] With generics `<T>`
            - [ ] `type Option<T> = T | None;`
    - [ ] Type aliases (`typedef`)
    - [ ] With generics `<T>`
    - [ ] Loading types from C
- Definitions
    - [x] Functions
    - [ ] Modules (to group functions and some external variables/constants for them)
    - [ ] Expression-returning functoins (`def sum(x: int, y: int): int => x + y;`)
    - [ ] Extension functions (`extend Type: func() { ... }`; also bunch of functions `extend Type { def func() { ... } ... }`)
    - [ ] Multiple and keyword function parameters (like in Python)
    - [ ] Function parameters with default values (like in Python)
    - [ ] Bindings with C functions/libraries (not only C?)
- Other
    - [ ] IO standart functions
    - [ ] Multiple files compilation (as a project)
    - [ ] Pure functions boost (memoization or smth)
    - [ ] Multi-threading programming support
